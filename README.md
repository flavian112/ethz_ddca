## Verilog Examples

Some verilog examples are located in the directory `verilog_examples`. To run an example, change directory to the corresponding example and run `make all` to compile and execute the testbench. Then run `make wave` to view the generated waveform.

Make sure to have [Icarus Verilog (iverilog, vvp)](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/) and [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net) installed.
